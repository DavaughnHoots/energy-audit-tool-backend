# Energy Audit Tool

## Overview
The Energy Audit Tool is a comprehensive Python-based solution designed to help homeowners and property managers understand and optimize their energy usage. It provides detailed analysis of energy consumption, humidity levels, HVAC performance, and lighting efficiency, along with actionable recommendations for improvements.

## Features
- **Energy Consumption Analysis**: Track and analyze your property's energy usage patterns
- **HVAC System Evaluation**: Assess heating and cooling system performance
- **Humidity Control**: Monitor and optimize indoor humidity levels
- **Lighting Efficiency**: Evaluate and improve lighting system performance
- **Cost Savings Recommendations**: Get practical suggestions for energy savings
- **Visual Reports**: Easy-to-understand charts and graphs
- **Product Recommendations**: ENERGY STAR certified product suggestions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- reportlab

## Usage

### Quick Start
```python
from energy_audit_tool import EnergyAuditTool

# Initialize the tool
audit_tool = EnergyAuditTool(
    power_consumed=50,    # Your average power consumption in kW
    duration_hours=10,    # Hours of operation
    seasonal_factor=1.2,  # Seasonal adjustment (0.8-1.2)
    occupancy_factor=0.9, # Occupancy adjustment (0.6-1.0)
    power_factor=0.92     # Power efficiency factor (0.8-1.0)
)

# Run analysis
results = audit_tool.run_analysis(building_data)
```

### Understanding Your Report

The tool generates a comprehensive report including:

1. **Energy Consumption Breakdown**
   - Base energy usage
   - Seasonal adjustments
   - Occupancy impacts
   - Actual consumption

2. **Comfort Metrics**
   - Humidity levels
   - HVAC performance
   - Lighting quality

3. **Savings Opportunities**
   - Immediate actions
   - Short-term improvements
   - Long-term investments

4. **Visual Analytics**
   - Energy usage charts
   - Efficiency comparisons
   - Performance metrics
